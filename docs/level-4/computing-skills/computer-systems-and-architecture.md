# Computer Systems and Architecture

Computer systems are built on a layered architecture that enables efficient data processing, storage, and control.  
This section explores the **fundamentals of computer architecture**, focusing on system organization, CPU design, instruction cycles, and performance metrics.

---

## The Von Neumann Model

The **Von Neumann architecture**, proposed by John von Neumann in 1945, describes a digital computing system in which **data and instructions share the same memory**.

### Characteristics

- Single memory space for data and program instructions.  
- Sequential execution of instructions (Fetch → Decode → Execute).  
- Control Unit (CU) manages instruction flow.  
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs computations.

    BUS[System Bus]
  end

  CPU --> MEM

  CPU --> I_O
  I_O --> CPU

  BUS --> MEM
```

## Harvard Architecture

Unlike Von Neumann, the **Harvard architecture** separates memory for **instructions** and **data**, enabling simultaneous access.

### Comparison

| Feature | Von Neumann | Harvard |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Memory | Shared for data and instructions | Separate for data and instructions |
| Speed | Slower (bus bottleneck) | Faster (parallel access) |
| Example Use | General-purpose computers | Microcontrollers, DSPs |

```mermaid

    DMEM["Data Memory"]
    I_O[I/O Devices]
  end

  CU --> IMEM
  CU --> DMEM
  ALU --> DMEM
  DMEM --> ALU
  CU --> I_O
```

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the **brain of the computer**, executing instructions through coordinated control and arithmetic operations.

### Key Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) | Performs arithmetic and logical operations |
| CU (Control Unit) | Decodes and coordinates execution of instructions |
| Registers | High-speed storage for temporary data and addresses |
| System Bus | Communication pathway between CPU, memory, and I/O |
| Clock | Synchronizes all CPU operations |

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph CPU
    CU[Control Unit]
    ALU[Arithmetic Logic Unit]
    REG[Registers]
    CLK[Clock]
  end
  CU --> ALU
  CU --> REG
  REG --> ALU
  ALU --> REG
  CU --> CLK
```

---

## Instruction Cycle

The **Instruction Cycle** describes how the CPU processes an instruction, typically through four main stages.

### Steps

1. **Fetch:** Retrieve the instruction from memory.  
2. **Decode:** Interpret the opcode and operands.  
3. **Execute:** Perform the operation via ALU or control logic.  
4. **Store:** Write results back to memory or registers.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  F[Fetch] --> D[Decode] --> E[Execute] --> S[Store] --> F
```

Each instruction requires multiple **clock cycles**, and performance depends on the efficiency of these stages.

## Memory Hierarchy

Memory systems balance speed, size, and cost through a **hierarchical organization**.

| Level | Type | Speed | Capacity | Example |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| L1 | CPU Registers | Fastest | Smallest | Program Counter |
| L2 | Cache Memory | Very Fast | Small | SRAM |
| L3 | Main Memory | Medium | Moderate | DRAM |
| L4 | Secondary Storage | Slow | Large | SSD / HDD |
| L5 | Tertiary Storage | Slowest | Very Large | Tape, Cloud |

```mermaid
graph TD
  R[Registers] --> C1[L1 Cache] --> C2[L2 Cache] --> M[Main Memory] --> S[Secondary Storage] --> T[Tertiary Storage]
```

The **principle of locality** (temporal and spatial) drives cache design — recently used data is likely to be reused soon.

---

## Buses and Communication

Data flow between components is facilitated by **system buses**:

| Bus Type | Function |
|-----------|-----------|
| Data Bus | Carries data between CPU and memory |
| Address Bus | Specifies memory location for data transfer |
| Control Bus | Carries control signals (e.g., read/write, interrupt) |

```mermaid

  CPU -->|Address Bus| MEM
  CPU -->|Data Bus| MEM
  CPU -->|Control Bus| MEM
```

---

## Machine Instructions and Assembly

Each CPU supports a specific **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** — defining valid operations and binary encodings.

### Example (Simplified)

| Assembly | Operation | Binary Example |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| `LOAD A, 1001` | Load value from memory address 1001 | 0001 1001 |
| `ADD A, B` | Add contents of registers A and B | 0010 0001 |
| `STORE A, 1010` | Store register A into memory | 0011 1010 |

```mermaid

  CU --> ALU
  ALU --> REG[Registers]
  REG --> MEM
```

---

## Pipelining

**Instruction pipelining** improves CPU throughput by overlapping execution phases of multiple instructions.

| Stage | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| IF | Instruction Fetch |
| ID | Instruction Decode |
| EX | Execute |
| MEM | Memory Access |
| WB | Write Back |

```mermaid
gantt
    dateFormat  X
    title CPU Instruction Pipeline
    section Stages
    IF :active, 0, 1
    ID : 1, 2
    EX : 2, 3
    MEM : 3, 4
    WB : 4, 5
```

Each instruction enters a different pipeline stage every clock cycle, increasing parallelism.

## CPU Performance Metrics

Performance can be expressed using **cycles per instruction (CPI)** and **clock frequency**.

$$
\text{Execution Time} = \frac{\text{Instructions}}{\text{Program}} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}
$$

Alternatively:

$$
\text{MIPS} = \frac{\text{Clock Frequency (Hz)}}{\text{CPI} \times 10^6}
$$

### Example

A processor with 2 GHz clock and average CPI = 1.5 executing 1 billion instructions:

$$
\text{Execution Time} = 10^9 \times 1.5 \times (0.5 \times 10^{-9}) = 0.75 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

## Cache Performance

Cache efficiency is measured via **Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)**:

$$
\text{AMAT} = \text{Hit Time} + (\text{Miss Rate} \times \text{Miss Penalty})
$$

- **Hit Time:** Time to access data in cache.  
- **Miss Rate:** Fraction of memory accesses not found in cache.  
- **Miss Penalty:** Time to fetch data from main memory.

Improving cache size and associativity reduces miss rate but increases cost and power consumption.

---

## Modern CPU Design

Modern CPUs include multiple cores, speculative execution, and branch prediction.

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph Multi-Core_CPU
    CORE1[Core 1]
    CORE2[Core 2]
    L1C[L1 Cache]
    L2C[L2 Cache]
    L3C[L3 Shared Cache]
    MEM[Main Memory]
  end

  CORE1 --> L1C
  CORE2 --> L1C
  L1C --> L2C
  L2C --> L3C
  L3C --> MEM
```

### Branch Prediction Example

Predicts the outcome of conditional branches before execution to minimize pipeline stalls.

$$
\text{Prediction Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Branches}} \times 100\%
$$
