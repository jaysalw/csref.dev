## Further reading and recommended resources

A curated list of books, interactive sites, tutorials and courses to continue learning beyond this section. Focus on one path (Python or JavaScript) to build fluency, then explore other languages to broaden concepts.

### Books (accessible and practical)

- "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" — Al Sweigart: practical beginner projects and real tasks.
- "Python Crash Course" — Eric Matthes: hands-on introduction with projects.
- "Think Python" — Allen B. Downey: a gentle introduction with exercises.

### Interactive practice sites

- Exercism (exercism.org): mentor-guided practice tracks in many languages.
- Replit / Repl.it: quick interactive editor to run small programs in the browser.
- HackerRank / LeetCode (easy problems): begin with easy practice problems to gain fluency.

### Tutorials and official documentation

- Official Python Tutorial — authoritative and concise.
- MDN Web Docs — JavaScript basics and browser APIs.

### Video courses and MOOCs

- Coursera: "Python for Everybody" by University of Michigan — beginner-friendly.
- edX/Codecademy: short guided interactive tracks.

### Recommended progression

1. Finish this Level 3 section and the end-of-section project.
2. Practice 2–3 problems per week on Exercism or HackerRank.
3. Move to Level 4 (software development, testing, and design) when you can write small programs with tests and simple file I/O.

If you'd like, I can add a language-specific reading path (JavaScript, Java, C#) with equivalent resources and example mappings. Tell me which language(s) you prefer and I'll extend this list.
