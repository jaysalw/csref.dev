## Exercises

These short exercises are suitable for practice or class tasks. Try to solve them without looking at solutions; then test incrementally.

1. Hello, name

   - Prompt the user for their first and last name and print a greeting in the form: "Hello, Ada Lovelace!"

2. Sum of list

   - Given the list [3, 7, 2, 9], compute and print the sum. Do it first with a loop, then with a built-in function.

3. FizzBuzz (short)

   - Print numbers from 1 to 30. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and for both print "FizzBuzz".

4. Word frequency

   - Write a function that accepts a short text string and returns a dictionary mapping words to counts (case-insensitive). Use it on the example in `examples.md`.

5. Small project â€” grade calculator

   - Read student names and scores from input (or a small text file). Compute and print each student's average and a class average. Save output in a new file.

Hints

- Start by writing small helper functions
- Test each function separately
- Add comments and docstrings for clarity
