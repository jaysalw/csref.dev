# Basic Programming — Level 3

This section introduces fundamental programming concepts suitable for Level 3 learners. It focuses on the core ideas you need to read, write, and reason about simple programs. The material is language-agnostic where possible, but examples use Python for clarity and conciseness.

Use the pages in this section to learn the basic building blocks of programming, practise small examples, and work through exercises that build into a small end-of-section project.

What you'll find here:

- Learning objectives and suggested prerequisites
- Concise topic pages covering variables & types, control flow, data structures, functions, and I/O & debugging
- Worked examples and short exercises with increasing difficulty
- A short assessment and further reading links

Use the left-hand navigation to access each topic page. This overview and the linked pages form a concise, printable guide to basic programming concepts.
