# Using Git — Practical guide

This page contains the detailed Using Git guide that was previously in the overview. It covers everyday commands and workflows you will use to manage code, collaborate with others, and safely recover from mistakes. Examples use the command line (PowerShell on Windows) and reference GitHub as a hosting service where relevant.

## What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version-control system that records snapshots of a project. It lets you track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states.

## Basic workflow (quick summary)

1. Create or clone a repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Edit files, stage changes, and commit with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to a remote and open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
5. Address review comments, merge the branch into the main branch, and pull the latest changes locally.

## Common commands (PowerShell examples)

- Configure Git (once per machine):

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

- Clone a remote repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
cd repo
```

- Create and switch to a branch (feature branch):

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/my-change
```

- Stage files and commit:

```powershell
git status
git add README.md src/module.py
git commit -m "Add preliminary module and update README"
```

- Push branch to remote:

```powershell
git push -u origin feature/my-change
```

- Update local main branch and merge remote changes:

```powershell
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## Inspecting history and differences

- View recent commits:

```powershell
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```

- See what changed in the working tree:

```powershell
git status
git diff            # unstaged changes
git diff --staged   # staged changes
```

## Branching strategies (simple guidance)

- Use short-lived feature branches for new work (one feature per branch).
- Keep `main` deployable; merge only reviewed, passing code.
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/login`, `fix/typo-README`.

## Collaborating and remotes

- `origin` is the default name for the remote you cloned from. Add other remotes for forks or upstream:

```powershell
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream/repo.git
```

- Fetch updates from a remote without merging:

```powershell
git fetch origin
```

- Rebase vs merge when integrating changes:
  - `git merge` produces a merge commit and preserves history.
  - `git rebase` rewrites your branch onto a new base to produce a linear history (use carefully, especially with shared branches).

Example: update your feature branch with latest main (merge):

```powershell
git checkout feature/my-change
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

Or using rebase (keeps a linear history):

```powershell
git checkout feature/my-change
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

## Resolving conflicts

- Conflicts happen when the same lines are changed in two branches.
- Steps to resolve:
  1. Git will pause the merge or rebase and mark conflict files.
  2. Open the files, search for conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and edit to the desired content.
  3. Stage the resolved files: `git add <file>`.
  4. Continue the merge (commit) or rebase (`git rebase --continue`).

Example conflict resolution (merge):

```powershell
# after `git merge origin/main` and conflicts appear
git status
# edit the files to fix conflicts
git add resolved_file.py
git commit -m "Merge origin/main: resolve conflicts in resolved_file.py"
```

## Undoing changes safely

- Discard unstaged changes in a file:

```powershell
git checkout -- path/to/file
```

- Unstage a staged file (keep working tree changes):

```powershell
git restore --staged path/to/file
```

- Amend the last commit (for small fixes, before pushing):

```powershell
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

- Revert a commit that is already in the history (safe for shared branches):

```powershell
git revert <commit-hash>
```

- Reset to a previous commit (rewrites history — avoid on shared branches):

```powershell
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## Useful tips and best practice

- Write clear commit messages: short subject (50 chars), blank line, optional longer body explaining why.
- Use `.gitignore` to keep build artifacts and credentials out of the repository.
- Use small, focused commits so changes are easier to review.
- Add tests and run them before pushing (CI systems will also run tests).
