# Using Git — Level 3

This page introduces practical Git usage for Level 3 learners. It focuses on everyday commands and workflows you will use to manage code, collaborate with others, and safely recover from mistakes. Examples use the command line (PowerShell on Windows) and reference GitHub as a hosting service where relevant.

## What is Git?

- Git is a distributed version-control system that records snapshots of a project. It lets you track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states.

## Basic workflow (quick summary)

1. Create or clone a repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Edit files, stage changes, and commit with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to a remote and open a Pull Request (PR) for review.
5. Address review comments, merge the branch into the main branch, and pull the latest changes locally.
