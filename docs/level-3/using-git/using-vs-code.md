# Using Git in VS Code — Level 3

This page explains how to use Git from within Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It focuses on the Source Control workflow, branching, resolving conflicts, pushing and pulling, and useful settings for a smooth development experience. Instructions are presented as concrete steps and commands; no interactive prompts are included.

## Prerequisites

- Install Git on the machine and ensure it is available in PATH. Verify by running `git --version` in a terminal.
- Install Visual Studio Code (current stable release).
- Configure Git user name and email globally if not already set:

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## Opening a repository

- Open the project folder in VS Code (`File → Open Folder` or `code .` from the repository root).
- The Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (left) shows the current repository state. If the folder is not a Git repository, initialise one with the `Initialise Repository` button or run `git init` in the terminal.

## Source Control view — daily workflow

- The Source Control view lists unstaged (Changes) and staged (Staged Changes) files. Use the plus icon next to a file to stage it, or the `+` at the top to stage all changes.
- Use the message box at the top of the Source Control view to type a concise commit message. Use the checkmark to commit staged changes.
- Common actions available from the file context menu:
  - Stage / Unstage
  - Discard changes (use with caution)
  - Open file history or compare with HEAD

## Branching and switching

- Click the branch indicator in the status bar (bottom-left) to view and switch branches, or to create a new branch.
- Creating a branch inside VS Code mirrors `git checkout -b <branch>` behaviour. Use descriptive branch names like `feature/add-login` or `fix/typo`.

## Pull, push and fetch

- Use the three-dot menu in the Source Control view or the status bar icons to `Pull`, `Push`, and `Fetch` from the remote.
- Regularly `Pull` (or `Fetch` + `Merge`/`Rebase`) to keep the local branch up to date with the remote. Use `Push` to upload local commits to the remote.

## Working with remotes and PRs

- VS Code integrates with GitHub through the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension (optional). The extension provides a UI to create, review and merge pull requests without leaving the editor.
- Remotes may be inspected and managed via the `Remote` commands or the terminal (`git remote -v`, `git remote add <name> <url>`).

## Resolving merge conflicts in VS Code

- When a merge or rebase results in a conflict, VS Code marks the conflicted files in the Source Control view and highlights conflict regions in the editor.
- The editor shows three actions for each conflict block: `Accept Current Change`, `Accept Incoming Change`, and `Accept Both Changes` (or `Compare Changes`). Use the action buttons to pick the desired result. Edit manually when a combined custom resolution is required.
- After resolving conflicts in all files, stage the resolved files and continue the merge or rebase (`git rebase --continue` if rebasing). Commit the merge if necessary.

## Stashing, undo and restore

- Use the terminal or the three-dot Source Control menu to access stash commands. Stash saves local changes for later reuse: `git stash`, `git stash pop`.
- Restore a file to the last committed state with `Discard Changes` from the file context menu in the Source Control view. Use carefully; this action is destructive for local modifications.

## Viewing history and blame

- The built-in timeline view shows local file history. Right-click a file and choose `Show Timeline` to inspect recent commits affecting that file.
- The Git: Toggle Blame Annotations command or extensions such as GitLens provide inline blame information and richer history exploration.

## Useful VS Code settings (recommended)

- Enable auto fetching to keep remote state fresh: set `git.autofetch` to `true`.
- Configure `git.enableSmartCommit` to allow committing without staging when appropriate, but prefer explicit staging for clarity.
- Ensure `files.eol` and core.autocrlf are set appropriately for team line-ending consistency. Use `.gitattributes` for repository-level control.

## Keyboard shortcuts (default)

- `Ctrl+Shift+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+G` (macOS) — Open Source Control view.
- `Ctrl+`` (backtick) — Toggle integrated terminal.
- `Ctrl+P` then `#` — Go to Symbol in File (for quick edits during conflict resolution).

## Troubleshooting common issues

- VS Code cannot find Git: ensure Git is installed and the path is visible to VS Code (restart the editor after installing Git).
- Credential prompts: use the Git credential manager for the platform (Windows Credential Manager on Windows) or the GitHub authentication extension.
- Merge conflicts remain after staging: ensure all conflicted files are resolved and staged before continuing a rebase or completing the merge.

## Cheatsheet (commands for reference)

```powershell
# Stage files and commit
git add <file>
git commit -m "message"

# Create and switch to a branch
git checkout -b feature/name

# Update local main and rebase feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/name
git rebase main

# Push branch to origin
git push -u origin feature/name

# Stash
git stash
git stash pop
```

## Policy and best practice reminders

- Use small, focused commits and meaningful messages.
- Keep `main` in a deployable state.
- Resolve conflicts locally and run tests before pushing.
