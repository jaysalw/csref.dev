# Emerging Technologies — Level 3

This page surveys a selection of recent and near-future technologies that influence computing and society. The aim is breadth and intuition rather than depth.

## Short survey

- Quantum computing — Computation using quantum bits (qubits). Not a universal replacement for classical computing, but promising for specific problems (e.g., certain optimisation and simulation tasks).
- Internet of Things (IoT) — Many small devices with sensors and networked connectivity. Useful for monitoring, automation and data-driven services.
- Edge computing — Moving computation closer to devices (the "edge") to reduce latency and bandwidth compared to cloud-only solutions.
- Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR) — New interfaces that blend or replace the physical world with digital content — used in training, simulation, entertainment and design.
- 5G and next-generation connectivity — Higher bandwidth and lower latency enable richer apps and more connected devices.

## Why these matter

These technologies change where and how computation happens (edge vs cloud), what is possible (simulations, new interfaces), and the kinds of data we collect and rely on. They often interact (e.g., IoT devices + edge computing + 5G).

## Risks and challenges

- Security: many new devices increase attack surface.
- Privacy: pervasive sensing can collect personal data unless designed carefully.
- Inequality: access to new tech can be uneven, creating digital divides.

## Short practical exercise

1. Pick one technology from the list and write a 150–250 word description of a realistic near-term use-case, identifying one technical challenge and one social/ethical concern.
