# Quantum Computing — A Short Introduction (Level 3)

Quantum computing uses quantum phenomena to represent and process information. It is not a general replacement for classical computers but can provide advantages for some specialised problems.

## Key ideas (intuitive)

- Qubits can exist in superposition — roughly, they can represent multiple states simultaneously.
- Entanglement links qubits so the state of one can depend on another.

## Potential applications

- Simulation of molecules and materials
- Certain optimisation and cryptographic problems (research ongoing)

## Limitations today

- Current devices are noisy and small (NISQ era).
- Many algorithms remain theoretical and require error-corrected machines.

## Short exercise

1. Read a short popular science article about quantum computing. Summarise in 6 bullets what quantum computing might enable and one reason it remains challenging.
