# Privacy & Scaling in Distributed Ledgers (Level 3)

Public blockchains trade transparency for privacy. Scaling (throughput and latency) is another important practical issue.

## Privacy approaches

- Pseudonymous addresses — provide some privacy but can be deanonymised.
- Layer 2 and privacy protocols — e.g., mixers, zk-SNARKs provide stronger privacy but add complexity.

## Scaling approaches

- Layer 2 solutions (payment channels, rollups)
- Alternative consensus mechanisms (proof-of-stake, delegated models)

## Exercise

1. Compare one public blockchain and one private/permissioned ledger: list advantages and expected use-cases for each.
