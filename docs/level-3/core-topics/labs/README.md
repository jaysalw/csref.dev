# Core Topics — Labs

This folder contains short, self-contained labs and scripts that accompany the Core Topics pages. Each lab is intentionally small so it can be run on a modest machine and used in-class or as homework.

Available labs

- AI / ML Lab — `ai-ml-lab.md` (uses `notebooks/ai_ml_demo.py`)
- Blockchain Lab — `blockchain-lab.md` (uses `notebooks/simple_ledger.py`)

Running labs

1. Install the optional lab dependencies from `requirements.txt` (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, jupyter) in a virtual environment.
2. Run the Python script from the repository root, for example:

    python notebooks\ai_ml_demo.py

Each lab page contains exercises and instructor notes.
