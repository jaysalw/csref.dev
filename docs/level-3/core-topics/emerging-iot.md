# Internet of Things (IoT) â€” Devices, Data, and Design (Level 3)

IoT covers connected devices that sense and act in the physical world. Examples include smart meters, wearables, and environmental sensors.

## Components

- Devices/sensors
- Connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, cellular)
- Backend services for storage, analysis and control

## Common concerns

- Security: devices often have limited resources and weak defaults.
- Data quality and calibration: sensors can drift or fail.

## Short exercise

1. Sketch a simple IoT system (sensor, network, backend) for a classroom temperature monitoring system and list three possible failure modes.
