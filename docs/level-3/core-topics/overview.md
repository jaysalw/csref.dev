# Core Topics — Level 3

This section covers current and emerging topics in computing that are important for modern study and practice. It is designed for Level 3 learners and focuses on high-level concepts, real-world examples, ethical considerations, and short practical activities you can try.

The main topics in this section are:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) — what it is, how it works in broad terms, where it is used, and the social and ethical questions it raises.
- Blockchain & distributed ledgers — the basic idea, common uses, strengths and limitations.
- Emerging technologies — a survey of recent and near-future developments (quantum computing, Internet of Things, edge computing, AR/VR, etc.) and why they matter.

Use the linked pages below for concise overviews and small exercises. Each page contains learning objectives, short explanations, and examples.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this section you should be able to:

- Explain, in simple terms, the core idea behind AI, blockchain, and at least two emerging technologies.
- Describe one or two practical uses for each area and identify basic limitations and risks.
- Discuss ethical and societal implications for AI and decentralised systems.
- Perform a short, guided practical task (e.g., experiment with a small AI demo, examine a simple blockchain transaction, or explore an IoT example).

### Suggested prerequisites

- Basic programming familiarity (Level 3 Basic Programming pages)
- Understanding of variables, functions, and simple data structures
- An interest in real-world applications and a willingness to read short technical summaries

### Short exercises (pick one or two)

1. Find and summarise a recent news story about AI deployment (education, healthcare, or creative tools). Identify one benefit and one risk.
2. Use an online blockchain explorer (or a simple simulated ledger) to view a transaction; note what information is public and what is private.
3. Pick an emerging technology (quantum, IoT, AR/VR) and write a 150-word explanation of a realistic near-term use-case.

If you'd like, I can expand any of these topic pages into fuller lesson notes, add worked examples, or create small notebooks/demos for the practical exercises.
