# Deep Learning â€” Intuition and Applications (Level 3)

Deep learning uses large networks of simple units (neurons) to learn complex patterns. It is especially effective for images, audio, and natural language.

## What is a neural network?

Think of a neural network as layers of simple calculators. Each layer transforms the data slightly; many layers together can learn very complex functions.

## When is deep learning useful?

- Image recognition (faces, medical scans)
- Natural language processing (chatbots, translation)
- Audio processing (speech recognition, music tagging)

## Limitations and costs

- Requires a lot of data and compute resources to train well.
- Models can be large and slow to run on small devices without adaptation.

## Short practical exercise

Try a pre-trained demo (image classifier or text generator). Identify one clear success and one failure case; think about why the model succeeded or failed.
