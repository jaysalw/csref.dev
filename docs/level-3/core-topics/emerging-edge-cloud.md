# Edge vs Cloud Computing (Level 3)

This short page outlines the difference between edge and cloud computing and when each is appropriate.

## Cloud computing

- Centralised servers run applications and store data.
- Good for large-scale processing, long-term storage, and central management.

## Edge computing

- Computation happens close to devices: on routers, gateways, or on-device.
- Reduces latency and bandwidth usage; useful when real-time response matters.

## Combined architectures

Many systems use both: edge devices perform immediate tasks while the cloud handles heavy analysis and long-term storage.

## Exercise

1. Give two examples where edge computing is better than cloud-only and explain why.
