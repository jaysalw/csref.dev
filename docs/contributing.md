## ðŸ§  Referencing Guide (IEEE Style)

All content must follow the **IEEE referencing style**, managed automatically via `mkdocs-bibtex`.

### 1. Add entries to the bibliography

Each cited source must appear in the shared file:

```
docs/references.bib
```

Use the following format (IEEE-compliant BibTeX):

```bibtex
@book{knuth1997,
  author    = {Donald E. Knuth},
  title     = {The Art of Computer Programming},
  volume    = {1},
  edition   = {3},
  year      = {1997},
  publisher = {Addison-Wesley}
}
```

> âœ… Use short, lowercase citation keys like `knuth1997` or `hoare1969`.

### 2. Cite sources in Markdown

Use the following syntax to reference an entry from `references.bib`:

```markdown
Algorithms are fundamental to computer science [@knuth1997].
```

When the site builds, this will render as:

> Algorithms are fundamental to computer science [1].

and the corresponding citation will appear in a **References** section at the bottom of the page.

### 3. Display the references section

Include this heading at the bottom of your page to define where citations appear:

```markdown
## References
```

If you donâ€™t include this heading, the reference list will automatically appear at the end of the page.

### 4. How references are displayed

Each citation will be automatically formatted in **IEEE style**, for example:

```text
[1] D. E. Knuth, *The Art of Computer Programming*, Vol. 1, 3rd ed. Addison-Wesley, 1997.
```

## How to Contribute
Contributions from everyone are welcome!
If you have:

* Lecture notes
* Clarifications or improved explanations
* Code examples or visual aids

Please submit them through a **Pull Request (PR)** or **GitHub Issue**.

When contributing:

1. Follow the IEEE referencing guidelines above.
2. Check existing `.bib` entries before adding duplicates.
3. Keep notes concise and focused on key learning outcomes.

## ðŸ§­ Example Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create** a new branch for your update.
3. **Edit or add** a `.md` file in the correct folder (e.g. `level-3/core-topics/`).
4. **Add new references** to `docs/references.bib` if needed.
5. **Cite** them in your text with `[@citationkey]`.
6. **Commit** and open a Pull Request.

Please note, references using the previous method are **not required** as long as you have listed sources at the bottom of any document you have created or modified.
