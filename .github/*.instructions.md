Please use British English spelling conventions throughout the project, including in code comments, documentation, and variable names.

For example:
- Use 'colour' instead of 'color'
- Use 'organise' instead of 'organize'
- Use 'centre' instead of 'center'
- Use 'analyse' instead of 'analyze'

This helps maintain consistency and clarity for all contributors.
