# csref.dev

Collaborative notes and references from **BSc (Hons) Computer Science** undergraduate studies.
This repository gathers summaries, explanations, and key concepts from various modules and topics, contributed by multiple students.

These notes will develop and more content will be added as time goes on, and as I progress through this course.
